# [Chat](https://garrettyoung510.github.io/chat/)

## Reasoning/Motivation

Built as a refresher on front end topics

## Technologies Used
* Vanilla JS (ternary, class, constructor)
* Real DOM manipulation (preventDefault, rendering the chat per room)
* Array Manipulation methods (.forEach, setTimeout)
* Firebase (database, snapshot methods like .docChanges)
* Bootstrap 
* Moment js for compatibility with github pages

## Challenges

* Getting the rooms to change chats, but figured out to clear the chat room and reupload the chats from the database
* Getting a format api for compatibility issues with github
* Refresher on array manipulation methods and vanilla JS

## Next Steps

* Authentication for people to login to chat
